# Nixpacks configuration for Railway deployment with GeoDjango

[phases.setup]
# Install system packages required for GDAL/GEOS/PROJ
aptPkgs = ["gdal-bin", "libgdal-dev", "libgeos-dev", "libproj-dev"]

# Note: [phases.install] removed to let nixpacks auto-detect requirements.txt
# This fixes "pip: command not found" error by letting nixpacks handle Python setup

[start]
# Start command (will be overridden by railway.json but kept for reference)
cmd = "gunicorn core.wsgi --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT"
